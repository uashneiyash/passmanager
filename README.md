Hello I'm Keoperz, you can call me "Keo" I was just sleeping and I remembered that I am having problem in storing passwords and I can't trust any other password manager so I thought of making my own.

maybe some bugs you found (fix ur self if u find one)
No marketing or my banner or other sh*t just code

You can modify it, if there is any issue then you can report it, just mention me or give me credit as well!!

## Installation


 - git clone https://github.com/uashneiyash/passmanager.git
 - cd passmanager
